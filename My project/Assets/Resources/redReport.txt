Take a seat. Can you recount the mission events for me?

<b>RED</b>
So, we left M.A.S.K. in BLUE’s car a little after PURPLE left in his rusty van—I mean, seriously, you’d think M.A.S.K. has a bit more funding to change that old—

<b>ORANGE</b>
Focus on the mission, RED.

<b>RED</b>
Right, Right...We parked a few blocks from the building, and GREEN and I waited for the go from the tech guy, PURPLE, before walking in. After he cleared us, we went in, found the guy, and I started hacking.
I think GREEN is too soft for this job. Anyway, where was I? Right, so I was swinging—

<b>ORANGE</b>
RED, please stay on track…

<b>RED</b>
Ugh, you ruin my fun, old man…
Anyway, that’s when I heard the radio go off and PINK telling us that SWAT has us surrounded. Which, you know me, wouldn’t be a problem except GREEN is a coward, so he dragged me out. 
It felt personal, not gonna lie…

<b>ORANGE</b>
*sigh* What happened next?

<b>RED</b>
When we got to the car, you know,<em> with the whole SWAT on our tail, </em> BLUE doesn’t wanna hit the gas. He rambled something about waiting for PINK blah blah blah. So I convinced him to go because the girl wasn't responding.

<b>ORANGE</b>
When did you realise PINK was dead?

<b>RED</b>
PINK is dead?! Huh. Can I get her sniper rifle? It looks FUN 

<b>ORANGE</b>
No, you may not...Why do I even bother with you…
What about PURPLE? What do you know about him?

<b>RED</b>
Who is PURPLE again?

<b>ORANGE</b>
Alright, that would be all. Please send in BLUE, and DON’T steal the rifle...
