I split up from the team at 9:00. I parked the van in an alley on 4th Street. I cut the footage at 9:20 and radioed the team to move in. There was just some normal chatter on the radio for a while.
I was just waiting for them to clear me to fix the cameras…

<b>ORANGE</b>
Go on...

<b>PURPLE</b>
PINK radioed that SWAT had the building surrounded and I— she...Uh...

<b>ORANGE</b>
Breathe PURPLE...

<b>PURPLE</b>
Sorry...I’m okay.
PINK said that there was someone on the roof with her. She sounded panicked, and before her line went dead, I heard a gunshot…

<b>ORANGE</b>
Did you hear anything else?

<b>PURPLE</b>
I heard the door to the roof creak, and then she asked whoever shot her something, but I can’t recall what

<b>ORANGE</b>
What happened next? Where did you go?

<b>PURPLE</b>
I panicked...I mean...It’s PINK.
I left my van in the alley and sprinted to where I knew she was located. I can’t remember how I got there, but by the time I did, whoever shot her was gone, and she was dead.

<b>ORANGE</b>
I’m sorry for your loss. I knew she meant a lot to you…
But I have to ask...Did you find anything else? 

<b>PURPLE</b>
*clinking sound*
I found this…

<b>ORANGE</b>
A bullet casing?

<b>PURPLE</b>
One of our own bullets. Standard M.A.S.K. issue, series <b>297331982</b>.

<b>ORANGE</b>
Thank you, PURPLE. That will be all.
