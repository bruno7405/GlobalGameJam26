Take a seat. Can you recount the mission events for me?

<b>BLUE</b>
I dropped RED and GREEN off, and waited in the car ‘cause I was the getaway driver. 
The next thing I know, PINK is saying something about SWAT pulling up, RED and GREEN are sprinting back. I tried contacting both PINK and PURPLE, but they were radio-silent after the SWAT call. 
I was gonna wait, and then that psycho RED had a knife up my throat to drive.

<b>ORANGE</b>
When did you realise PINK was dead?

<b>BLUE</b>
I had my suspicions after she radioed, but I didn’t know for sure until we got back to M.A.S.K. and she wasn’t there. However, I am more interested in PURPLE.

<b>ORANGE</b>
Why is that?

<b>BLUE</b>
Because it’s been three days after the incident, and he’s yet to show up. I just find it weird.

<b>ORANGE</b>
Thank you, BLUE. You can let the team know that’s all.
