Recount the mission events for me?

<b>GREEN</b>
We left base at 9:10 in BLUE’S car. PURPLE took the van and left before us. 
We dropped off PINK so she could get to her lookout spot. We get in the building once PURPLE gives us the green light, kill the target...You know? Easy mission.
Then PINK blows up our radio when the SWAT team pulls up. I head out the back. RED gets it in her head that she's gonna take on the SWAT team by herself. Have I mentioned that I’m never working with her again?

<b>ORANGE</b>
Keep going, GREEN...

I have to DRAG this psycho out before she gets us both killed. We ran straight to BLUE’s car, got in the back, but he would not drive—kept saying we had to wait for PINK.
Finally, after we radioed her a few times, RED put a knife to his throat, and he finally drove off.

<b>ORANGE</b>
When did you realize PINK was dead?

<b>GREEN</b>
We assumed she just left, and it wasn’t until we got back to M.A.S.K. that we found out that she died.

<b>ORANGE</b>
What about PURPLE?

<b>GREEN</b>
We’ve not heard anything in three days. Not since he took out the cameras and told us to go in. If you ask me, I think it’s convenient that he just disappeared.

<b>ORANGE</b>
Thank you, GREEN. That will be all. Send in RED.
